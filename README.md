# Parkisons-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can detect Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements. The goal is to support early screening by analyzing vocal features that commonly change when Parkinson’s symptoms begin to appear.The main aim of this project is to use machine learning to classify whether a person is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on numerical voice features such as pitch, jitter, shimmer, and frequency variations.
Approach
  parkisons dataset --> data-preprocessing --> train-test-split -- >support vector machine classifier
  new data --> trained support vector machine classifier --> predictiion (parkison's or healthy)
